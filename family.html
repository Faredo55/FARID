                    <p>My family is like a strong pillar for me, on which I can blindly rely anytime I require support. From my family, I have learned the social graces of loyalty and cooperation. My family consists of my father (Md Tahir), my mother (Hanisah), my sister (Wanny) and myself (Farid). My family has always been there to motivate and encourage me to overcome all difficulties in life and achieve success. Every member of my family has a unique and important role. Thanks to Allah, I have grown up in a family full of love and discipline. My family values will definitely help me become a better person.</p>
