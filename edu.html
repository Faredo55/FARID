                    <h2>Education</h2>
                    <p>My educational journey began at a young age, when I was sent to kindergarten at the age of five. Then I continued my education at the primary school level, which is in two schools, Sekolah Kebangsaan Rapat Setia and Sekolah Kebangsaan Sultan Sulaiman 1. For high school, I have also attended two schools, which are Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Seksyen 9 and Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Seri Mahkota. Now I am continuing my studies at the diploma level at UiTM Rembau.</p>

                    <h2>Experience</h2>
                    <p>I learned many interesting things throughout my life in school and university. At school, I was very involved in activities organised by the school such as tug-of-war and often my group won the event. At university, it's different, I can get to know more people from various backgrounds and I can also learn many skills that are not taught in school, such as communication and leadership skills.</p>
